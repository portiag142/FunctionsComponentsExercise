CREATE REACT APP

Create React App is a simple Command Line (AKA Terminal) command to run which sets up everything we need to start creating a React Web App

The command to run is..

npx create-react-app app-name

NOTE: The command will create a folder with all the React features inside it. This folder will be created inside of the the folder that command is run inside of. Also, what is put after "create-react-app" (In this case "app-name") will be the name of the created folder. Finally, it is common practice to use all lowercase letters separated by hyphens (Example: my-app)

The "src" folder is where new components are created. Each file should contain a single component with the same name as the file.

Commands to start/compile the React app after it has been created...
